## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to the project maintainer with the following information:

- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] ECEngine Vulnerability Report`
- **Description**: Detailed description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include minimal reproduction code

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the investigation
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will not take legal action against researchers who report vulnerabilities in good faith
- We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it
- We will acknowledge your contribution in our security advisories (if desired)

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation

ECEngine processes JavaScript code as input. While designed for safe evaluation, consider these security aspects:

#### Potential Risks
- **Infinite Loops**: Malicious code could create infinite loops
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Large expressions could consume excessive memory
- **Code Injection**: While ECEngine doesn't execute arbitrary system commands, be cautious with user input

#### Mitigation Strategies
- **Timeouts**: Implement execution timeouts for long-running operations
- **Resource Limits**: Set memory and CPU usage limits
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize user input
- **Sandboxing**: Run ECEngine in isolated environments for untrusted code

### Safe Usage Guidelines

#### For Developers
```csharp
// Safe: Simple expressions
var result = interpreter.ExecuteCode("1 + 2");

// Caution: User input - validate first
var userInput = GetUserInput();
if (IsValidExpression(userInput))
{
    var result = interpreter.ExecuteCode(userInput);
}

// Recommended: Use timeouts
using var cts = new CancellationTokenSource(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
var result = interpreter.ExecuteCodeWithTimeout(userInput, cts.Token);
```

#### For Production Use
- Always validate user input before execution
- Implement execution timeouts
- Monitor resource usage
- Log execution attempts for audit trails
- Consider rate limiting for user-facing applications

### Known Security Features

#### Current Protections
- âœ… **No File System Access**: ECEngine cannot read/write files
- âœ… **No Network Access**: ECEngine cannot make network requests  
- âœ… **No System Commands**: ECEngine cannot execute system commands
- âœ… **Limited Built-ins**: Only safe built-in functions are implemented
- âœ… **Memory Safe**: Uses .NET's memory management

#### Planned Security Enhancements
- ðŸ”„ **Execution Timeouts**: Automatic timeout for long-running operations
- ðŸ”„ **Resource Monitoring**: Memory and CPU usage tracking
- ðŸ”„ **Input Validation**: Enhanced input sanitization
- ðŸ”„ **Audit Logging**: Detailed execution logging

### Common Vulnerabilities

#### Not Applicable to ECEngine
- **SQL Injection**: ECEngine doesn't interact with databases
- **XSS**: ECEngine doesn't generate web output
- **CSRF**: ECEngine doesn't handle web requests
- **File Path Traversal**: ECEngine doesn't access file systems

#### Potential Concerns
- **Denial of Service**: Malicious code could consume resources
- **Logic Bugs**: Parser/interpreter bugs could cause unexpected behavior

### Security Testing

#### Automated Scanning
Our CI/CD pipeline includes:
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Static code analysis for security issues
- **Dependency Scanning**: Check for vulnerable dependencies
- **Secret Scanning**: Prevent accidental secret commits

#### Manual Security Review
- Regular code reviews with security focus
- Penetration testing of key components
- Security-focused unit tests

### Vulnerability Assessment

#### Current Risk Level: **LOW**

**Reasoning:**
- Limited scope (expression evaluation only)
- No system access capabilities
- Memory-safe .NET runtime
- No network or file system access

#### Risk Mitigation
- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- Automated security scanning
- Community vulnerability reporting
- Responsive security patch process

### Security Updates

#### Update Policy
- **Critical**: Released immediately upon discovery
- **High**: Released within 7 days
- **Medium**: Included in next minor release
- **Low**: Included in next major release

#### Notification Methods
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- Documentation updates

### Contact Information
